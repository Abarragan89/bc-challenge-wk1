# Week 1 Challenge
This is the first coding challenge for my coding bootcamp. I was to refactor code to consolidate CSS stylings and enhance the HTML by using semantic tags to organize the content. 
## Here is the users story:
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
## Here is the acceptance requirements: 
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
